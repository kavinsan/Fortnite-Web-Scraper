This script makes uses of the python selenium webscraper library to scrape data
from the fortnitetracker website. 

Why did i create this script?
    Fortnite tracker provides an API to use their database however they do not
    have all the stats data that one might need/want. Also their api retrieves
    data that is inaccurate compared to the data presented on their website.
    
    I also use this script for my discord bot (written in javascript)
    
How to use this script?
    python scraper.py <platform> <username>
    
        -> platform: pc, psn, xbl
        -> username: A valid username for fortnite
        
Output?
    When successful the script should prompt "done", otherwise "error" if unsuccessful.
    data.json file should be created in the same directory
        -> Contatains data for solo, duo, squad in the respected order
